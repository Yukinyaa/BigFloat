# BigFloat
Arbitrary accurate big number in C#.
Made for incremental game

***DISCLAMER : Code is not tested thoroughly and provided AS-IS***

there isn't even test code ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

# How to use idk
Intended for UnityEngine.

To use outside unity, change m to double and Mathf to Math then there *should* be no problem
